# Adversarial examples

Implementation of adversarial attack on different deep NN classifiers, the attacks are base on the algorithms in the papers :

* [Adversarial Attacks and Defences Competition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00097.pdf).
* [Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572v3.pdf).
* [Intriguing properties of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199).
